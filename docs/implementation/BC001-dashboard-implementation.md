- Filter and pagination DTOs ready for query parameters

### 4. Module Integration
**File**: `/backend/src/dashboard/dashboard.module.ts`
- Dashboard module properly configured
- Integrated into main app module
- Ready for dependency injection

## Frontend Implementation ✅

### 1. Mock UI Development
**Components Created**:
- `DashboardStatsCards` - Statistics cards with trend indicators
- `DepartmentBreakdown` - Department resource breakdown with progress bars
- `RecentActivities` - Activity feed with action icons and timestamps
- `QuickActions` - Role-based quick action buttons

### 2. Mock Data Generation
**File**: `/frontend/src/lib/mock-data/dashboard.ts`
- Realistic dashboard statistics
- Sample recent activities with various action types
- Department breakdown data with percentages
- Chart data structures ready for visualization
- Quick action stats for system health

### 3. Dashboard Page Implementation
**File**: `/frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Complete dashboard layout with responsive design
- Loading states and error handling
- Role-based UI behavior
- Navigation integration for quick actions
- Success/error notifications

### 4. TypeScript Types
**File**: `/frontend/src/types/dashboard.ts`
- Complete type definitions for all dashboard data
- Interfaces matching backend DTOs
- Type-safe props for all components

## Key Features Implemented

### Statistics Cards
- Total Idle Resources count
- Urgent Resources (≥2 months idle) with warning styling
- Available Now count with success styling
- Assigned This Week count with info styling
- Weekly comparison with trend indicators

### Department Breakdown
- Visual progress bars for each department
- Idle count and urgent count per department
- Percentage distribution
- Responsive card layout

### Recent Activities
- Activity feed with action type icons
- Relative timestamps (e.g., "2h ago")
- Color-coded action types
- "View All" navigation to history page

### Quick Actions
- Role-based button visibility
- Add Resource, Import, Reports, Manage Users, History, Refresh
- Tooltips with action descriptions
- Navigation integration

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with flexbox layouts
- Grid layouts for desktop optimization
- Material-UI components for consistency
- Hover effects and smooth transitions

## Role-Based Features

### Admin Role
- Full access to all dashboard features
- User management quick action
- All statistics and breakdown data

### RA (Resource Administrator) Role  
- Resource management capabilities
- Import/export functionality
- Full statistics access

### Manager Role
- Department-filtered data (prepared for BE implementation)
- Resource management for their department
- Reports access

### Viewer Role
- Read-only access to basic statistics
- Limited quick actions (refresh only)
- No sensitive data exposure

## Business Logic Integration Points

All components are prepared for business logic implementation with TODO comments indicating where real API calls and data processing will be added:

1. **Statistics Calculation** - Real-time aggregation from database
2. **Role-based Filtering** - Department restrictions for Managers
3. **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket integration for activity feed
4. **Data Caching** - Performance optimization for statistics
5. **Permission Checks** - Granular access control
6. **Audit Logging** - Activity tracking for dashboard actions

## Integration Status

- ✅ **Backend Structure Complete** - All endpoints and services ready
- ✅ **Frontend UI Complete** - All components functional with mock data  
- ✅ **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript coverage
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Proper error boundaries and notifications
- ✅ **Loading States** - Skeleton loaders implemented
- ✅ **Responsive Design** - Mobile and desktop optimized
- ✅ **Role-based Access** - UI adapts to user permissions

## Next Steps (Business Logic Phase)

The dashboard foundation is ready for business logic implementation in tasks BE001-BE004:

1. **BE001**: Real database statistics calculation
2. **BE002**: Navigation menu logic with permissions  
3. **BE003**: User logout functionality
4. **BE004**: Quick actions and auto-refresh

All TODO comments in the service layer provide detailed guidance for implementing the actual business logic while maintaining the established API contracts.

## Testing Ready

- Backend builds successfully
- Frontend builds and compiles without errors
- All mock data provides realistic testing scenarios
- Components handle loading and error states properly
- Role-based features ready for permission testing

The BC001 Dashboard Base Implementation task is **COMPLETE** and ready for handoff to the Business Logic implementation phase.
